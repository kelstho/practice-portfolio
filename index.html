                My name is Kelly Thompson, and I am a barista living in Kansas City, Missouri. I’ve lived here for a little over two years now, and I’m really excited to be learning about coding!

            <p>
                I was born and raised in Lawrence, Kansas. I graduated from Lawrence High School in 2011, and I received a BFA in Photography from the Lesley University College of Art and Design in 2016. Since then, I have been working in the coffee industry as a barista. Coffee is one of my greatest passions, but I’m ready for a big career change and am hoping to be hired as a web developer after my graduation from this boot camp.
