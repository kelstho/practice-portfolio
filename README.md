# Portfolio

For this project, I updated my personal portfolio page with a new design that is more responsive and customized than my initial design. I added links to LinkedIn, Github, and a PDF of my resum√©. I also updated my actual portfolio with projects that I have actually completed, instead of placeholders. I picked a light orange/light blue color scheme, which is complimentary, and pleasing to the eye.
