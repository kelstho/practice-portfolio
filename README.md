# Portfolio

For this project, I updated my personal portfolio page with Project 2, (Gif It To Me) as well as two other homework assignments (Profile Generator and Template Engine). I also reformatted the titles of the projects for easier readability, and changed the ordering of the projects. My Github profile is now also up to date with my portfolio page. I worked on my resume and LinkedIn about a week ago, updating all information.
